PROJECT_NAME : portfolio-project
PROJECT_DESCRIPTION : This repository showcases Jeong Eun Seong's portfolio. It contains various projects that I have worked on. The website presents these projects in a 3D space. The project leverages several advanced technologies, including fine-tuned AI models using OpenAI's GPT-3.5, Three.js for 3D rendering, and an optimal algorithm to categorize and display the projects. It utilizes full-stack development for both backend and frontend functionalities. Additionally, the server crawls my GitHub repository daily to update the portfolio website automatically.
